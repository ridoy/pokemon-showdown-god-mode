# Issue Tracker

Because using the Github issue tracker feels too fancy for now.

## Functionality
~~F1 Adjustable slideout for damage container~~
F2 Elegant UI for considering possible enemy items (Use a warning message for now: "damage ranges may be higher or lower than expected depending on the enemy's held item)
F3 Elegant UI for entire matrix of matchups
F4 Add other generations (this is crucial if I ever want anyone to use this tool)

## Bugs
B1 Regional form bugs
B2 include Z moves in calculations
